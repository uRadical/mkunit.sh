# mkunit

> mkunit is a CLI tool for creating systemd unit files quickly and easily.

mkunit takes the pain out of writing systemd unit files. Instead of manually creating .service, .timer, .path, .socket, .mount, and .target files, mkunit generates them with a single command.

## Key Features

- Interactive mode for guided unit file creation
- Scriptable for CI/CD and automation
- Supports all common systemd unit types: service, timer, path, socket, mount, target
- Built-in security hardening options
- Automatic installation and service management
- Shell completions for bash, zsh, and fish

## Quick Start

Install via Cargo:
```
cargo install mkunit
```

Create a simple service:
```
mkunit service myapp --exec "./server" --install --start
```

Create a timer (cron replacement):
```
mkunit timer backup --on-calendar "daily" --exec "/usr/local/bin/backup.sh" --install
```
